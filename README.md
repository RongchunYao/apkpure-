please first take a look at my_conf.py
this tool will not duplicately download apps
$[keywd].txt: apps that successfully downloaded
app.txt: all apps name 
there are two places u can modify in apkpure.py: first is page of apps that u download.U can comment it to download all apps. (I can not afford so much time to download all pages of apps just to test). And the second is timeout of downloading apps, with defaulted value 300

another interesting thing:
	the website only have 14 apps per page, but the website take it as 15
